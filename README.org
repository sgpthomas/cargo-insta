* Package for interacting with cargo-insta command line

This is a very simple package to accept / reject snapshots produced by [[https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta][insta]], a Rust snapshot testing library.

** Installation

*** Elpaca

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package cargo-insta
  :ensure (cargo-insta :type git :host github :repo "sgpthomas/cargo-insta")
  :defer t)
#+end_src

** Usage

The command =cargo-insta= is the main command of this package. Either call it directly, or bind it to something convenient. This pops open a buffer that will show you any pending snapshots.

Pressing =a= on a snapshot will accept it, and =r= will reject it.
